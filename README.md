# MediaSoft

Website made using react with gatsby for the company that I work for. 
This project is my own idea as the current company website is old and needs to be rebuild.
I'm doing this project on my free time.

### What I'm using
* React
* GatsbyJS
* Styled Components
* GraphQL
* DatoCMS
* React-Final-Form & Fonk-Final-Form

#### Disclaimer

I'm building this and at the same time learning about these technologies because my employer never wanted me to use them, so this is my 
chance to show him and the company that we can work better when using what's already out there instead of building everything from ground up.

If you want to use this do this:
`npm install` 
then
`npm run start`

It should start on localhost:8000

#### Another Disclaimer

If you want to use this with the contact form you have to write a backend that will verify the re-captcha and send the mail.
Then just change the `url` variable in the Form.js file to that backend's link
